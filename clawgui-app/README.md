**ClawGUI-app** is the on-device Android deployment module of [ClawGUI](../README.md), corresponding to the "deploy ClawGUI-Agent on a real phone" track in the main roadmap. It runs the full ClawGUI "brain + GUI agent" stack directly on one Android phone, removing the old split architecture where a desktop host orchestrates tasks and the phone only executes them. The app is built on top of [Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku) for high-privilege, non-root device control. Two agents cooperate:

- **brain**: a function-calling LLM that understands intent, selects tools, and manages sessions and memory
- **phone agent**: a VLM-driven executor that inspects the screen and performs tap / swipe / type actions

On the product side, execution status is exposed through a floating overlay, text input is stabilized with a built-in IME, traces are persisted for replay and debugging, and external channels such as Feishu can send tasks into the app.

## ✨ Highlights

- **Phone-only workflow**: a rooted device or a device with Shizuku is enough; no desktop coordinator is required
- **Two-agent design**: the brain handles planning and tool orchestration, while the phone agent handles screen understanding and action execution
- **Conversation + automation in one app**: this is not just a script runner; it includes sessions, long-term memory, external channels, and traces
- **Built for real usage**: overlay status, IME, session persistence, external messages, and diagnostics are all part of the main product flow

## 🚀 Quick Start

ClawGUI requires several permissions and system integrations, including Shizuku, overlay permission, and IME setup. The shortest path:

1. Install [Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku) and the ClawGUI APK
2. Start Shizuku using the method that matches your Android version
3. Open ClawGUI and complete Shizuku authorization, overlay permission, and optional IME setup
4. Configure your brain / VLM provider and API key in Settings
5. Validate the setup with simple commands such as `Open WeChat` or `Go back to home screen`

Developer environment requirements, APK build steps, Shizuku startup methods for different Android versions, and troubleshooting are documented in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).

## 🏗️ Architecture

ClawGUI-app uses two agents:

- **nanobot / brain** (`core/nano/`)
  - A function-calling LLM
  - Understands user intent
  - Decides whether GUI manipulation is required
  - Orchestrates tools such as `gui_execute`, `read_memory`, and `write_memory`
  - Manages sessions, memory, traces, and external channels

- **phone agent / VLM executor** (`core/phone/`)
  - Takes over after being delegated through `gui_execute`
  - Captures screenshots
  - Calls the configured VLM
  - Parses actions
  - Executes `tap / swipe / type / launch / scroll` through Shizuku

Runtime flow:

```text
User / Feishu message
        ↓
   nanobot (brain)
        ↓
  gui_execute tool call
        ↓
 phone agent (VLM)
        ↓
 Screenshot → plan action → execute via Shizuku
        ↓
 Return result to brain → write session / reply to channel / persist trace
```

## 📦 Current Capabilities

### In-app conversation

- Main chat screen for direct instructions
- Drawer-based session management
- Floating overlay during execution
- Manual stop support

### GUI automation

- Launch apps
- Tap, long-press, double-tap, swipe, back, and home
- Text input through a built-in IME path
- Multi-step planning on the current screen

### Sessions and memory

- Local multi-session persistence
- Long-term memory tools: `read_memory` / `write_memory`
- Recent history and trace injection to reduce repeated actions

### External channels

- Feishu bot integration
- External messages written into the app inbox
- Read-only inspection of external sessions inside the app

### Observability

- Per-turn traces persisted to `workspace/traces/<date>/`
- Optional diagnostic log export
- Foreground service + overlay feedback during execution
